## Game Description

Our game is a multiplayer downward scrolling adventure game where the playersâ€™ goals are to collect resources and discover what is deeper down in the world through mining blocks and exploring caves.

## Advanced Topic Description

### Procedural Generation

We will procedurally generate terrain on a vertically-infinite 2D grid, including ore clusters, biomes, and structures. Generation will use a noise function and a random number generator.

### Networking

We will support real-time multiplayer using a server-client architecture via UDP and create a server browser via TCP. The server and clients will stay in sync via a custom protocol.

## Midterm Goals

* General
	* Save and load game state
	* Player movement
* Procedural Generation
	* Simple generated terrain in a finite world
	* Cave generation
* Networking
	* Server that can support at least one client
	* Synchronization between server and client(s)

## Final Goals

* General (20%)
	* 5%: User interface
	* 5%: Simple inventory
	* 5%: Mining
	* 5%: 60 FPS
* Procedural (30%)
	* 10%: At least 2 distinct biomes
	* 10%: Infinite world (downward)
	* 10%: Ore generation
* Networking (30%)
	* 10%: Only sync changes, not entire state
	* 15%: Can sync at least 4 clients
	* 5%: Single-change sync occurs in less than 1 frame

## Stretch Goals

* Unique underground structures
* Server browser
